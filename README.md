# Event-Manager---The-Odin-Project

This challenge has been adapted from The Turing School’s and Jump Start Lab’s Event Manager and updated to make use of GoogleCivic API. For the first task, I was to determine the government representatives for each attendee based on their zip code (as provided by the CSV file). For each attendee, we were then to include a customized letter that thanks them for attending and provides a list of their representatives (each attendee letter can be found in the output folder).
